    <h1>Hobbies:</h1>
    <h2>Skating</h2>
    <p>I started skating in high-school and haven't made much progress in terms of tricks.</p>
    <p>I can however comfortably ride basically anywhere, which is what I wanted to learn when I started.</p>
    <p>Sadly Mizzou's campus is pretty notorious for their sidewalks and streets.</p>
    <p>I live on East Campus and most of the pieces of concrete for the sidewalk aren't even connected, and the road is
        bricks.</p>
    <p>Regardless I do manage to go out every now and then and skate around for fun.</p>
    <h2>Concerts</h2>
    <p>I really like going to see the artists I listen to live at concerts with friends.</p>
    <p>Although most of the time they are <b>EXPENSIVE</b> if you manage to get them right when they drop they aren't
        terrible</p>
    <p>I have been to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Baby Keem</li>
        <li>$uicideBoy$ (twice)</li>
        <li>$not</li>
        <li>Waka Flocka</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I will be going to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wiz Khalifa</li>
        <li>Joey Bada$$</li>
        <li>J.I.D</li>
        <li>Smino</li>
    </ul>
    <i>I wanted to go to Drake, and the tickets were on sale this week actually, but they were unfortunately
        <b>EXPENSIVE!!</b></i>
    <h2>Video Games</h2>

    </i>
    <h3>God of War: Ragnarok</h3>
